## Simple word tokenisation in Python

A simple set of fuctions designed to quickly create come basic stats for a given document and then visualise them. 
These are not designed to be replacements for NLTK but are a look at how to go about building personalised word stat functions.

Furthermore, visualisations are designed to give you a quick over view of the document. 

## Getting Started

I've tried to make these functions as 'plug-and-play''able as possible. Their also very easy to edit for those looking personalise for their own use.
