the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta's recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place the jury further said in term-end presentments that the city executive committee which had over-all charge of the election deserves the praise and thanks of the city of atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted the september-october term jury had been charged by fulton superior court judge durwood pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard-fought primary which was won by mayor-nominate ivan allen only a relative handful of such reports was received the jury said considering the widespread interest in the election the number of voters and the size of this city the jury said it did find that many of georgia's registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous it recommended that fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them the grand jury commented on a number of other topics among them the atlanta and fulton county purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments merger proposed however the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration the city purchasing department the jury said is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies it urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem implementation of georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury it urged that the next legislature provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected the grand jury took a swipe at the state welfare department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes this is one of the major items in the fulton county general assistance program the jury said but the state welfare department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of fulton county which receives none of this money the jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties nevertheless we feel that in the future fulton county should receive some portion of these available funds the jurors said failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on fulton taxpayers the jury also commented on the fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation wards protected the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries the atlanta bar association and an interim citizens committee these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms the jury said regarding atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences the jury did elaborate but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable ask jail deputies on other matters the jury recommended that 1 four additional deputies be employed at the fulton county jail and a doctor medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail 2 fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes the jury praised the administration and operation of the atlanta police department the fulton tax commissioner's office the bellwood and alpharetta prison farms grady hospital

hartsfield announced that he would run for reelection georgia republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race a top official said wednesday robert snodgrass state gop chairman said a meeting held tuesday night in blue ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience state party chairman james dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held 8 in savannah at which newly elected texas john tower will be the featured speaker in the blue ridge meeting the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters despite the warning there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate according to republicans who attended when the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race it voted no and there were no dissents the largest hurdle the republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race one of two alternative courses must be taken 1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot or 2 the republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system a system which the party opposes in its platform sam caldwell state highway department public relations director resigned tuesday to work for garland byrd's campaign caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time he will be succeeded by rob ledford of gainesville who has been an assistant more than three years when the gubernatorial campaign starts caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for byrd the georgia legislature will wind up its 1961 session monday and head for home where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly before adjournment monday afternoon the senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item construction bonds meanwhile it was learned the state highway department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds the bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of georgia's most heavily traveled highways a highway department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of rural roads authority bonds for rural road construction work a revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the rural roads authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then marvin griffin the highway department source told the constitution however that vandiver has been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds schley county pelham will offer a resolution monday in the house to rescind the body's action of friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances pelham said sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought while emphasizing that technical details were fully worked out pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the house voted through 87-31 a similar resolution passed in the senate by a vote of 29-5 as of sunday night there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action pelham pointed out that georgia voters last november rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future legislature sessions a veteran jackson county legislator will ask the georgia house monday to back federal aid to education something it has consistently opposed in the past mac barber of commerce is asking the house in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds barber who is in his 13th year as a legislator said there are some members of our congressional delegation in washington who would like to see it the resolution passed but he added that none of georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution the resolution which barber tossed into the house hopper friday will be formally read monday it says that in the event congress does provide this increase in federal funds the state board of education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises colquitt after a long

austin texas committee approval of price daniel's abandoned property act seemed certain thursday despite the adamant protests of texas bankers daniel personally led the fight for the measure which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous legislatures in a public hearing before the house committee on revenue and taxation under committee rules it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week but questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next 31 he told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since texas was a republic it permits the state to take over bank accounts stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more the bill which daniel said he drafted personally would force banks insurance firms pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer the escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property daniel declared dewey lawrence a tyler lawyer representing the texas bankers association sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers if you destroy confidence in banks you do something to the economy he said you take out of circulation many millions of dollars charles hughes of sherman sponsor of the bill said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the pockets to banks insurance and pipeline companies his contention was denied by several bankers including scott hudson of sherman gaynor jones of houston brady of harlingen and howard cox of austin cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since he said it would impair contracts he also complained that enough notice was given on the hearing since the bill was introduced only last monday austin texas senators unanimously approved thursday the bill of george parkhouse of dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in dallas and the four other largest counties the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state there was no debate as the senate passed the bill on to the house it would authorize the texas education agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools permitting older ones to attend the residential texas school for the deaf here operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of dallas harris bexar tarrant and el paso would be $451,500 which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed parkhouse told the senate the tea estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in dallas county saving them from coming to austin to live in the state deaf school dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between red berry and joe ratcliff while details are still to be worked out ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in dallas why he thinks berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected we're getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting said ratcliff but i believe if people were better informed on this question most of them would oppose it also i'm willing to stake my political career on it berry an ex-gambler from san antonio got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies a house committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report although the resolution faces hard sledding later the house passed finally and sent to the senate a bill extending the state health department's authority to give planning assistance to cities the senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of house bills approved by committees passing the three on the calendar one validated acts of school districts another enlarged authority of the beaumont navigation district the third amended the enabling act for creation of the lamar county hospital district for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted without dissent senators passed a bill by schwartz of galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the gulf coast district money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the state hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site two tax revision bills were passed one by louis crump of san saba would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized instead retailers would sign a certificate of correctness violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison plus a $1,000 fine it was one of a series of recommendations by the texas research league the other bill by aikin of paris would relieve real estate brokers who pay their own annual licensing fee from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain under a bill by frank owen 3 of el paso to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas marshall formby of plainview former chairman of the texas highway commission suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the legislature and congress eliminating the need for costly special elections under formby's plan an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor lieutenant governor speaker of the house attorney general and chief justice of the texas supreme court austin texas state representatives decided thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes texans would prefer to pay an adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the state affairs committee a bill which would order the referendum on the april 4 ballot when texas votes on a senator wesley roberts of seminole sponsor of the poll idea said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill the west texan reported that he had finally gotten chairman bill hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on 22 the proposal would have to receive final legislative approval by two-thirds majorities before march 1 to be printed on the april 4 ballot roberts said opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice all dallas members voted with roberts except bill jones who was absent austin texas paradise lost to the alleged water needs of big cities thursday james cotten of weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the texas house of representatives was an effort by big cities like dallas and fort worth to cover up places like paradise a wise county hamlet of 250 people when the shouting ended the bill passed 114 to 4 sending it to the senate where a similar proposal is being sponsored by george parkhouse of dallas most of the fire was directed by cotten against dallas and parkhouse the bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project cotten construed this as a veiled effort by parkhouse to help dallas and other large cities get money which cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural texas statements by other legislators that dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill did sway cotten's attack the bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like buchanan of dumas eligio kika de la garza of mission sam collins of newton and joe chapman of sulphur springs this is a poor boy's bill said chapman dallas and fort worth can vote bonds this would help the little peanut districts austin texas a houston teacher now serving in the legislature proposed thursday a law reducing the time spent

or senior high school teaching certificate a normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching the remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects a person with a master's degree in physics chemistry math or english yet who has taken education courses is permitted to teach in the public schools said grover college teachers in texas are required to have the education courses fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined grover as

several defendants in the summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest judge james parsons was told in criminal court yesterday the disclosure by charles bellows chief defense counsel startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial bellows made the disclosure when he asked judge parsons to grant his client alan clements 30 a separate trial bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom fears prejudicial aspects the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client bellows told the court some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property it is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others judge parsons leaned over the bench and inquired you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this yes your honor replied bellows what this amounts to if true is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case there is a conflict among the defendants washington july 24 president kennedy today pushed aside other white house business to devote all his time and attention to working on the berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio the president spent much of the week-end at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port a white house spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion decisions are made asked to elaborate pierre salinger white house press secretary replied i would say it's got to go thru several more drafts salinger said the work president kennedy advisers and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia's demands and proposals for the city the last 10 cases in the investigation of the 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john karns who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons he said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris wexler special prosecutor issue jury subpoenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building but did take them before the grand jury mayer goldberg attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward argued this procedure constituted intimidation wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning karns said it was a wrongful act for wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room he said this constituted a very serious misuse of the criminal court processes actually the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county altho vindication of the authority of that court is the function of this court said karns who is a city judge in east louis sitting in cook county court faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another the cases involved judges in the 33d 24th and 42d precincts of the 31st ward the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward the 18th precinct of the 4th ward and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns two other cases also were under advisement claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed he would dismiss them washington 9 president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs the president in a special message to congress tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools and expand child health care and general medical research the aged care plan similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator a fight on capitol hill it was defeated in congress last year cost up to $37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent 3 per cent on each worker and employer on the first $4,800 of pay per year the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent 3.25 per cent each similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system the payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting 1 1963 if the plan is approved because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year 1963 both figures would go higher in later years other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years these would be paid for out of general payroll taxes nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days 2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital a patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit 3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient 4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the expense but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings or those of their children caused by an extended hospital stay this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs he said and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals this is a program of socialized medicine it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed every person will choose his own doctor and hospital wouldn't pay doctors the plan does cover doctor bills they would still be paid by the patient apart from the aged care plan the president's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care moreover he said many qualified young people are going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students the schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships based on need of up to $2,000 a year per student in addition the government would pay a $1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966 the president recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones more for nursing homes in the area of community health services the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction he asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals in the child health field the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation he did say by how much for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase from 30 to 50 millions in matching grants for building research facilities the president said he will also propose increasing by an unspecified amount the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine the president said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program people knowledge services facilities and the means to pay for them reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the president's plan those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message senate republican leader dirksen and house republican leader charles halleck said the message did persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first house speaker sam rayburn called the kennedy program a mighty fine thing but made no prediction on its fate in the house washington 9 acting hastily under white house pressure the senate tonight confirmed robert weaver as the nation's federal housing chief only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote a number of scattered ayes and noes was heard customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency in the last eight years all presidential appointments including those of cabinet rank have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of wayne morse in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961"
